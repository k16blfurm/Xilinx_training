-- comment:
--   This package provides a convenient mechanism for encapsulating all of the
--   modules used in the uart_led project. To access these module definitions,
--   all one must do is name the library where the package is
--   stored and implement a  use  statement. Typically, this module may reside
--   where all the other VHDL sources exist and, by default, this file will
--   appear in the  WORK  library. The  WORK  library is accessed by default so
--   the  library work;  statement is optional. The next line should read  use
--   WORK.uart_led_pkg.all; which will make all of the contents of this package
--   available to the file in which this statement exists.
--
--   Note that only modules that make use of any of the contents in this package 
--   are required to explicitly connect to it.
--
--   The package also includes a number of constants and user defined enumerated 
--   types. 
--
--   As a rule of thumb, I place all the component instantiations in a package 
--   to reduce the  clutter 
--   within a file.
--
--   Types, subtypes, functions, procedures, and constant are included if they are 
--   used by more than one module. This reduces errors due to inconsistant usage.
--
